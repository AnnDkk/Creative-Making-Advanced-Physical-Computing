## Introduction




## WEEK 6
This week we had a group discussion according to the topic requirements given by the teacher. Each team member made her own preliminary presentation of the project.
* My idea one:
<Future Plant>
The project was inspired by ‘Gentle Monster’ exhibition on the future of technology. Human beings have been pursuing a scientific and intelligent society, thus ignoring the relationship between biology, ecology, and science and technology. From the perspective of the robots and mechanical animals that have evolved today, it may be possible to predict how plants will exist in the future. 
I started with this and collected the relevant cases and found that there are already many people in the pursuit of a plant that will never die. A plant that grows according to people's wishes. Many artists have also made some bionic plants to show the artistic aesthetics of combining technology and life in the future. But I want to criticize this kind of mechanized tame behavior. Humans have been trying to use technology to rewrite the original fate of living things. But maybe that's not life anymore.

So in this project, I wanted to create a combination of mechanical plants to critique this manipulative behavior.
