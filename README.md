## Introduction




## WEEK 6
This week we had a group discussion according to the topic requirements given by the teacher. Each team member made her own preliminary presentation of the project.
* My idea one:
<Future Plant>
The project was inspired by ‘Gentle Monster’ exhibition on the future of technology. Human beings have been pursuing a scientific and intelligent society, thus ignoring the relationship between biology, ecology, and science and technology. From the perspective of the robots and mechanical animals that have evolved today, it may be possible to predict how plants will exist in the future. 
I started with this and collected the relevant cases and found that there are already many people in the pursuit of a plant that will never die. A plant that grows according to people's wishes. Many artists have also made some bionic plants to show the artistic aesthetics of combining technology and life in the future. But I want to criticize this kind of mechanized tame behavior. Humans have been trying to use technology to rewrite the original fate of living things. But maybe that's not life anymore.  
So in this project, I wanted to create a combination of mechanical plants to critique this manipulative behavior.

* My idea two:
<smelling>
This project is about emotional visualization. The increasing number of patients with mental illness caused me to think deeply. Most of the time emotions are not visible and many people can't tell. Therefore, I hope to make a device that can draw the form of emotion through three-dimensional picture frame and balloon pressure sense

## WEEK 7
After the report from the team members last week, we decided to choose future plants as our final topic and tried to combine the diversified forms of plants.

* Sketch
According to the concept and research background, we drew a mind map and a rough sketch of the device

> Firstly, acoustic sensors and pressure sensors were used as input devices to control plant reception signals, and servo and chicken silk were used as output devices to express plant feedback to people.

* Modeling  
  
  I used nomad to draw the 3d model

* The problem
We had a problem making the mechanical flowers. We don't know which flower form can be expressed. We don't know how to use the output device in our design. So we made an appointment with Matt's toturial to study. Matt not only provided a new idea for our output device: using a telescopic rod. It also helped us solve the expression form of mechanical flowers.

## WEEK 8
> It's been a very difficult week 
>> Circuit testing and welding is our main work. 
 
Since we had a lot of output devices, we borrowed PCA9685 from the professor to control multiple servo to work together.

But we tried to write a lot of code and modify the circuitry in a way that didn't allow this part of the control servo to work. We asked Professor Pete about it. But the ultimate problem remains unresolved. Maybe an Arduino board controls too much equipment, maybe there is a problem in the code, etc...  
  
In order to better complete the project within the specified time. We redesigned the circuit diagram again. And - welding, testing. Finally, our new solution is successful!!
